# codesearch_claude4
A Flask-based web application almost purely generated by a large language model (Heard from my roommate that Claude 4.0 was released, so I immediately came to try it out) (I'm sweating 🥲, a similar requirement for my undergraduate thesis design tormented me for months, and was easily surpassed by AI in less than an hour)

# Prompt
Due to my reluctance to use the paid version in previous attempts, resulting in exceeding the usage window limit repeatedly, and some modifications not being recorded, I will only post the prompt from the last attempt that generated the frontend code here (provided to Claude Opus 4).
```
你能写一个在本地端口上跑的一个web应用吗？主要功能是可以对用户上传的代码文件进行分项目保存，并通过一个搜索框找到最语义匹配的函数位置。要求用python写后端，前端框架没要求。
然后基于这个基本需求，我有以下十个需求需要你进行改进，精益求精，1、前端界面要美观，ui组件要时尚，有动画感；2、要支持RAG，而不仅仅是硬皮配3、要支持上传一整个大的文件夹，而不是一个一个文件，即支持目录结构4、代码展示ui要好看一些，最好能实时修改代码5、页面要多一些，不要全挤在一个页面6、要能够展示每个文件的在项目中的文件结构和依赖关系7、支持暗黑模式8、支持手机端网页浏览的版本9、支持github仓库的实时推送10、函数详情展示要详细，不能只是一个函数名，展示信息全面而不冗余、也不显得占用很大位置。
我现在已经写好的后端代码如下，请帮我完成前端html文件代码并确保能正常运行：[//这里是已经生成好的后端python代码]

# Environment
- Windows 11 (AMD); other platforms should also work fine
- python-3.13.3; relatively recent Python 3 versions should also work
- Third-party library dependencies: Requires the command `pip install flask flask-cors numpy scikit-learn sentence-transformers GitPython`; 3-4GB or more disk space is recommended

# Local Run Steps
1. Execute `python app.py` and wait for the model initialization to complete
2. Open `index.html` in a browser

# Estimated Cost
2.5 $ (Assuming a single generation meets the requirements)

# Notes
- I directly pasted the generated code and made no modifications to its content – it passed the compilation and execution stages and ran successfully.
- Based on brief personal testing, I found that this project still has some obvious flaws:
  - The function extraction feature seems problematic and not comprehensive.
  - The function detail display window for each search result is not user-friendly; at 100% scale, there is no close button.

Overall, it was still very shocking to me, hence this record – 2025-5-26-2:48
